TypeSafe SDK
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can point an existing [TypeSafe](https://docs.typesafe.ai/)
 client at OpenRouter by changing its base URL. Requests to System One models such as [Jev](https://openrouter.ai/typesafe/jev-1.13)
 are then billed to your OpenRouter account and routed through OpenRouter’s System One API. The TypeSafe SDK is available for JavaScript and TypeScript (`@typesafe-ai/sdk`) and for Python (`typesafe_sdk`). If you would rather call Jev without the TypeSafe SDK, use the [Decisions API](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api/api-reference/alphadecisions/submit-a-decisions-questions-and-answers-request)
 directly or through the OpenRouter [TypeScript](https://openrouter.ai/docs/client-sdks/typescript/sdks/decisions/README)
, [Python](https://openrouter.ai/docs/client-sdks/python/sdks/decisions/README)
, or [Go](https://openrouter.ai/docs/client-sdks/go/sdks/decisions/README)
 SDK. The [Jev tutorial](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/community/jev-tutorial)
 walks through that path from the first request to a threshold decision.

### 


Base URL

OpenRouter’s System One API is available at the following base URL:

    https://openrouter.ai/api
    

The SDK appends `/v1/systemone` to the base URL, so requests are sent to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/systemone`.

### 


Authentication

Use your [OpenRouter API key](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)
 as the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The SDK sets this header from the `apiKey` option (`api_key` in Python) or the `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` environment variable.

### 


Migrating an existing client

Change the base URL and the API key. Everything else stays the same.

client.ts

client.py

    import { TypeSafeClient } from '@typesafe-ai/sdk';
    
    const client = new TypeSafeClient({
      apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
      baseURL: 'https://openrouter.ai/api',
    });
    

    import os
    
    from typesafe_sdk import TypeSafeClient
    
    client = TypeSafeClient(
        api_key=os.environ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"],
        base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api",
    )
    

Both SDKs also read the base URL from the `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL` environment variable, so you can leave the constructor unchanged and set `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api` and `TYPESAFE_API_KEY=<your OpenRouter API key>` instead.

### 


Evaluating state against questions

triage.ts

triage.py

    const result = await client.systemOne({
      model: 'jev-1.13',
      state: 'I was charged twice for my subscription.',
      questions: {
        refund: { type: 'noul', instructions: 'Is the customer asking for money back?' },
        department: {
          type: 'choice',
          instructions: 'Which team should handle this?',
          criteria: { billing: 'Charges and refunds', technical: 'Bugs and outages' },
        },
      },
    });
    
    console.log(result.answers.refund); // { type: 'noul', noul: 0.98 }
    

    result = client.system_one(
        model="jev-1.13",
        state="I was charged twice for my subscription.",
        questions={
            "refund": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "Is the customer asking for money back?"},
            "department": {
                "type": "choice",
                "instructions": "Which team should handle this?",
                "criteria": {"billing": "Charges and refunds", "technical": "Bugs and outages"},
            },
        },
    )
    
    print(result.answers["refund"])
    

### 


Model IDs

The System One API accepts TypeSafe’s bare System One model IDs and maps them onto OpenRouter’s `typesafe/` namespace before routing:

*   `jev-1.13` is routed as `typesafe/jev-1.13`.
*   `jev-latest` is routed as `~typesafe/jev-latest`, OpenRouter’s alias for the newest Jev release.
*   IDs that already carry an author prefix, such as `typesafe/jev-1.13`, are used as-is.

The `model` field in the response contains the OpenRouter model ID of the System One model that served the request.

### 


Supported endpoints

*   `POST /api/v1/systemone` sends state and typed questions to a System One model and returns its answers.

The TypeSafe SDK’s model listing (`client.models.list()` in JavaScript) calls `GET /api/v1/models`, which is OpenRouter’s [Models API](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api/api-reference/models/list-all-models-and-their-properties)
 and returns OpenRouter’s response shape rather than TypeSafe’s, so the SDK rejects it. Browse [OpenRouter’s System One models](https://openrouter.ai/typesafe)
 or call the Models API directly instead.

### 


Request and response format

The System One API implements TypeSafe’s request and response shapes. Requests require `model`, `state`, and `questions`, and responses contain `model`, `answers`, and `usage`. OpenRouter additionally returns `id`, `provider`, and `usage.cost`, which both SDKs pass through without error.

systemone.sh

    curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/systemone \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "jev-1.13",
        "state": "I was charged twice for my subscription.",
        "questions": {
          "refund": {
            "type": "noul",
            "instructions": "Is the customer asking for money back?"
          }
        }
      }'
    

Response

    {
      "id": "gen-dec-1789738314-X5e5eKGQdvR9rblyX250",
      "model": "typesafe/jev-1.13-20260917",
      "provider": "TypeSafe",
      "answers": {
        "refund": { "type": "noul", "noul": 0.98 }
      },
      "usage": { "input_tokens": 275, "output_tokens": 20, "cost": 0.00003 }
    }
